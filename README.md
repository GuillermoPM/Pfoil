This program was created as part of the final thesis for the bachelor degree in aerospace engineering in the Universidad de Le√≥n. The main 
objective was to get a deeper understanding of the transpiration methods, and use it as a tool in the thesis. The information needed to develop this project was taken from the Fudnamentals of Aerodynamics from author Mark Drela, the XFOIL documentation and the MFOIL code from professor Krzysztof J. Fidkowski from Michigan Ann Arbor.

This was not meant to substitute the XFOIL, so it's not as fast or as accurate as that code. However, the Python programming language offers a
more modern approach to this well known software, and it gave the author the chance to develop his programming skills on a higher level. Once again, the professor Krzysztof J. Fidkowski MFOIL was of great help, specially in the viscous part where some functions where taken from that code and implemented in Python, so it could work all together as a full program with its own GUI.

The code can be used following the MIT license, an as it was said before, the programming skills are more of a beginner than a programmer, so it may be possible that some parts of the code could be updated and optimized. If I have the time, I'll implement more features and upload them as new versions of the program.
